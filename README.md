# Arctis-7-Battery-Rainmeter-Skin

A project for a friend who has a SteelSeries Arctis 7 and wanted to make a rainmeter skin to display its battery.

I have included both the script that gets the battery level of the headset and serves that information on a webserver as well as the
rainmeter skin which parses the battery level from the website and displays it with a cool battery icon (made by yours truly :3)
